# Here we'll try to explain what we will do in this repository
## writting a triangle file where we can get the output of the area of the triangle and perimeter of it.
# Triangle
### This function will return the area of this triangle as we set the area
- Triangle : area = a*h/2
```
def area(a, h):
    return a*h/2
```
### At the same way thus function will return the perimeter of this triangle.
- Triangle: P = a+b+c
```
def perimeter(a, b, c):
    return (a+b+c)
```

## writting a rectangle file where we can get the output of the area and perimeter of it.
# Rectangle
### This function will return the area of this rectangle as we set the area
- Rectangle : area = a*b
```
def area(a, b):
    return a*b
```
### At the same way thus function will return the perimeter of this rectangle.
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
```
def perimeter(a, b):
    return 2*(a+b)
```
## writting a square file where we can get the output of the area of the square and perimeter of it.
# Square
### This function will return the area of this square as we set the area
- Square : area = a*a
```
def area(a):
    return a*a
```
### At the same way thus function will return the perimeter of this triangle.
- Square : perimeter = 4*a
```
def perimeter(a):
    return 4*a
```
## writting a circle file where we can get the output of the area of the circle and perimeter of it.
# Circle
### This function will return the area of this circle as we set the area
- Circle: S = πR²
```
def area(R):
    return π*(R*R)
```
### At the same way thus function will return the perimeter of this circle.
- Circle: P = 2πR
```
def perimeter(R):
    return 2*π*R
```
