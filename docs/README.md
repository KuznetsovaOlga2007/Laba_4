# How to use calculator:
1. Run `python calculate.py`
2. Enter the figure name. Available are Circle, Square.
3. Enter the function: Area or Perimeter.
4. Enter figure sizes. Radius for circle, one side for square.
5. Get the answer!

# Math formulas
## Area
- Circle: `S = πR²`
- Rectangle: `S = ab`
- Square: `S = a²`
- Triangle: `S = sqrt(p * (p-a) * (p-b) * (p-c))` where p is semiperimeter

## Perimeter
- Circle: `P = 2πR`
- Rectangle: `P = 2a + 2b`
- Square: `P = 4a`
- Triangle: `P = a + b + c`

## Troubleshooting
- Input Errors: Ensure you enter valid numeric values for dimensions.
- Figure Not Recognized: Make sure to enter the figure name exactly as shown (case-sensitive).
- Help: If you encounter issues, check your Python environment and libraries.
