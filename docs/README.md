# Geometric Library

Geometric Library is a Python library designed to perform geometric calculations. This library provides various functions to calculate areas, perimeters, and volumes of different geometric shapes, including circles, rectangles, and spheres.

## Key Features:
- Calculate area and perimeter for various shapes.
- Efficient algorithms for geometric computations.
- Easy to integrate with other projects.

# How to use calculator:
1. Run `python calculate.py`
2. Enter the figure name. Available are Circle, Square.
3. Enter the function: Area or Perimeter.
4. Enter figure sizes. Radius for circle, one side for square.
5. Get the answer!

# Math formulas
## Area
- Circle: `S = πR²`
- Rectangle: `S = ab`
- Square: `S = a²`
- Triangle: `S = sqrt(p * (p-a) * (p-b) * (p-c))` where p is semiperimeter

## Perimeter
- Circle: `P = 2πR`
- Rectangle: `P = 2a + 2b`
- Square: `P = 4a`
- Triangle: `P = a + b + c`
